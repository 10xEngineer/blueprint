\fBblueprint\-create\fR \- create a blueprint
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBblueprint create\fR [\fB\-d\fR \fIsubtrahend\fR] [\fB\-P\fR|\fB\-C\fR|\fB\-S\fR|\|\.\|\.\|\.] [\fB\-m\fR \fImessage\fR] [\fB\-r\fR] [\fB\-q\fR] \fIname\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBblueprint\-create\fR creates a list of all installed packages and modified configuration files and stores it in the branch \fIname\fR in the local blueprint repository with the commit \fImessage\fR (if given)\.
.
.P
If standard input is not a TTY, a blueprint is read from standard input rather than created from the system\. See \fBblueprint\fR(5) for the details of the format\.
.
.P
If a \fIsubtrahend\fR is given, it is subtracted from the generated or provided blueprint and the difference is committed as \fIname\fR\.
.
.P
If one of \fB\-\-puppet\fR, \fB\-\-chef\fR, \fB\-\-sh\fR, or \fB\-\-cfn\fR is given, a Puppet module, a Chef cookbook, POSIX shell code, or an AWS CloudFormation template will be generated, written to a file or directory in the current working directory, and its filename will be printed to \fBstdout\fR\.
.
.P
Debian packages, Ruby gems, Python packages, and PHP PEAR/PECL packages are enumerated in the blueprint\. Debian packages that are listed as \fBessential\fR, \fBimportant\fR, \fBrequired\fR, or \fBstandard\fR and those that are depended upon by \fBubuntu\-minimal\fR, \fBubuntu\-standard\fR, or \fBubuntu\-desktop\fR are ignored\.
.
.P
The contents of system configuration files in \fB/etc\fR that have been created or modified from their packaged versions will be included in the blueprint\.
.
.P
Anything installed in \fB/usr/local\fR will be archived and included in the blueprint, tagged with the architecture (\fIamd64\fR or \fIi386\fR) of the server\.
.
.P
\fBblueprintignore\fR(5) provides means for ignoring specific files and packages plus treating arbitrary directories as \fB/usr/local\fR is treated\.
